  <p>My name is Marlon Angulo. I was born in Miami, FL on March 27, 1991. I lived here most of my life. After graduating high school my first son Daniel was then born. I then enrolled to study Computer Engineering in Miami-Dade College. At the age of 22 I decided to join the military. I enlisted in the Navy as a Yeoman (administrative assistant). I was stationed in south California for those years and was able to serve on two platforms that took me overseas for 1.5 years. After I finished my contract I decided to stay in San diego while I continue my college education. In the Fall of 2020 I decided to relocate back to Miami and enroll into FIU to finish my bachelors in Computer Science. I reentered the work force in the fall of 2021 as a Loan Officer Assistant. After working there for a year I was laid off and decided it would be a great opportunity to enter CodeFellows to launch my career as a Web Developer. My current goal is to finish this program and begin my career in Front-End development.
